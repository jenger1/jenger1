👀 I’m interested in the field of environmental conservation and sustainability, advocating for a greener and more sustainable planet.

🌱 I’m currently learning about renewable energy, sustainable practices, and environmental policy to drive positive change and protect our natural resources.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that promote environmental awareness, sustainable development, and eco-friendly initiatives.

📫 If you're passionate about environmental conservation or have ideas to make a difference, let's connect and work together.
